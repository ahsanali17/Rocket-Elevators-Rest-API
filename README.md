# Rocket-Elevators-Rest-API

This repo serves as the Rocket Elevators REST API developed for CodeBoxx's week 9 of the Odyssey program. Last week we were tasked with developing a REST API to interact with the MYSQL database that already exists, and provide the appropriate requests for queries. This week we need to add additonal functionality to our RestAPI to develop our informations system further through the use of 

The queries for the REST API are found in a public PostMan workspace at: https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=5d0b4faee94fb95dd13ea6256cd9fe19

A working example of the the REST API URL is: https://rocket-api-boom.azurewebsites.net//api/interventions/pending , or you can join the postman link above and get the links.

You will have to test the PUT request yourself to check that a 'pending' intervention can be changed to 'In-progress' and eventually 'Completed'. More about that below.



--- Intervention Request: ---

1. GET Select All Interventions - Returns all the interventions and the informations pertaining to them that are in the backoffice. 

2. Get Select One Intervention - Returns one intervention by ID from the backoffice.

3. Get Pending Interventions - Returns all interventions that are currently 'pending' and need to be processed by the employee.

4. Put #1 -In-Progress - Changes the status of an intervention from 'pending' to 'in-progress'. Note: you will need goto the Postman link above and underneath the url for the requests, click body and change it to RAW and the dropdown bar should change from TEXT to JSON  

5. Put #2 -Completed - Changes the status of an intervention from 'pending' to 'Completed. Note: Follow the same instruction above in (#4) but inside the JSON text change the status to 'Completed' instead of 'In-progress'.
